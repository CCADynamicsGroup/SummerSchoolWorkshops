    "The purpose of this tutorial is to: \n",
    "1. Introduce the concepts of Age-Velocity Dispersion relations\n",
    "2. Introduce Cross matching via topcat\n",
    "3. Introduce/practice velocity calculations via astropy \n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: You will derive the Gaia DR2-GALAH Age-Velocity Dispersion relations. Two additional challenges include: (1) derive the same Age-Velocity Dispersion relations but for  Gaia DR3-GALAH (hint!: this will require a cross match) and (2) consider uncertainties in age and velocity to build a linear model which converts velocity dispersion into age.\n",
