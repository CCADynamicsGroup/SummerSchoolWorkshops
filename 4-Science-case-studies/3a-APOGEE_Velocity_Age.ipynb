    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this tutorial is to: \n",
    "1. Introduce the concepts of Age-Velocity Dispersion relations\n",
    "2. Introduce Cross matching via topcat\n",
    "3. Introduce/practice velocity calculations via astropy \n",
    "\n",
    "Goal: You will derive the Gaia DR2-APOGEE Age-Velocity Dispersion relations. Two additional challenges include: (1) derive the same Age-Velocity Dispersion relations but for  Gaia DR3-APOGEE (hint!: this will require a cross match) and (2) consider uncertainties in age and velocity to build a linear model which converts velocity dispersion into age.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are **two reach goals** if you can get there:\n",
    "1. Fit the Age-velocity & Age-velocity dispersion relations simeltenously, using MCMC (emcee) \n",
    "2. Use what you learned above to determine whether its better to use the Age-Vz dispersion or Age-V_theta relation to derive the age of a unkonwn population assuming you have well-measured the velocities.\n",
