## Workshop materials for the 2021 Applied Galactic Dynamics Summer School

This repository contains the IPython notebook tutorials for the summer school
workshop sessions. Each subdirectory here that is prefaced with a number
corresponds to the theme for a given day of the workshop week.

We intend for everyone to run and these notebooks on your local machines.
However, in case you have trouble with your Python environments, we also provide
a Binder interface to the tutorials instead (requires a Google account):

**Important note about the Binder interface:** We cannot guarantee any
persistence of data or code in the Binder notebooks, so please be aware that you
could lose your progress through the tutorials at any point (unless you download
them periodically to save your work).
