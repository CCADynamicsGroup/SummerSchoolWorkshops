## Workshop materials for the 2021 Applied Galactic Dynamics Summer School

This repository contains the IPython notebook tutorials for the summer school
workshop sessions. Each subdirectory here that is prefaced with a number
corresponds to the theme for a given day of the workshop week.

We intend for everyone to run and these notebooks on your local machines.
However, in case you have trouble with your Python environments, we also provide
a Binder interface to the tutorials instead (requires a Google account):
