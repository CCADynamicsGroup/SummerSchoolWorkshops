    "## Learning goals\n",

    "In this tutorial, we will introduce triaxial potential models, and explore the additional complexity that this brings to the landscape of orbits, as compared to orbits in axisymmetric potential models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last tutorial, we saw that reducing the symmetry of a potential from spherical to axisymmetric reduced the number if isolating integrals of motion from four to three. Will removing another potential symmetry — going from axisymmetric to triaxial — further reduce the number of isolating integrals? Luckily no: It turns out that regular orbits in triaxial potentials still have three isolating integrals. However, the orbit structure of triaxial potentials is more complex: A new type of orbit family can exist in triaxial potentials known as \"box orbits,\" and tube orbits (what we are familiar with from axisymmetric models) can only exist around either the short or long axis of the potential. Triaxial potentials also generally have larger regions of chaotic orbits, making chaos more relevant in triaxial mass models.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce some triaxial gravitational potential models, demonstrate the different types of orbits that can exist in triaxial models, and compare chaotic and regular orbits.\n",

    "## Triaxial Potential Models\n",
    "\n",
    "To recap the last tutorial, we found that we could define axisymmetric potential–density pairs by replacing the spherical radius with a elliptical radius that scales the $z$ axis differently. Axisymmetric models are useful for defining potentials for flattened mass distributions, such as from galaxy disks. Triaxial potential models are models in which the isopotential or isodensity contours coincide with ellipsoidal surfaces. These models are useful for representing the outskirts of dark matter halos (which have been found to be triaxial, to first order) and for representing the stellar distributions in elliptical galaxies. \n",
    "\n",
    "To create a triaxial potential, we can  instead replace the spherical radius with an ellipsoidal radius defined as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r^2_{\\rm ell} = \\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \\frac{y^2}{b^2} + \\frac{z^2}{c^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where often by convention, $a$ is set to $a=1$ so that $b$ is the $y/x$ *axis ratio* and $c$ is the $z/x$ axis ratio. As with the axisymmetric models, we can either replace the radius in the expression of a spherical potential, or replace the radius in the expression of the density function, but these have different effects. Ideally, we would want to replace the radius in the form of a spherical density with the ellipsoidal radius, because then the density would be guaranteed to be positive and physical at all positions. However, there are very few triaxial solutions to Poisson's equation known, so most triaxial density distributions do not have analytic expressions for the potential (or gradients, which we need to compute orbits). It is therefore common to instead replace that radius in a potential expression with an ellipsoidal radius, but this has the same caveat as we saw with axisymmetric models that for some choices of $b, c$ the density can become negative. \n",

    "## Integrals of Motion and Orbit Classes in Triaxial Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Regular orbits in triaxial potential models still have three integrals of motion, however, like in the axisymmetric case, these are again not easily associated with classical integrals or analytic expressions. Regular orbits do have actions, but the interpretation of the actions often depends on the type of orbit being studied. To understand this a bit more, we need to look at the different types of orbit families that exist in triaxial potential models. Recall that in spherical models, all orbits are planar, and generic orbits form rosette patterns because of radial and azimuthal oscillations that often have an irrational frequency ratio. In axisymmetric models, orbits conserve the $z$ component of their angular momentum and so preserve their circulation around the symmetry axis of the potential, forming vertically-thickened analogs to the planar rosette patterns called \"tube\" orbits. In triaxial models, there are four general classes of orbits: short-axis tube orbits, \"inner\" long-axis tube orbits, \"outer\" long-axis tube orbits, and box orbits. \n",

    "## Irregular and Chaotic Orbits\n",
    "\n",
    "A final class of orbits that are found in very flattened axisymmetric potentials and more frequently in triaxial potentials are known as *chaotic* orbits. There is a lot to say about chaos, but one way of thinking of chaotic orbits are that they are special orbits in which the actions do not exist: only energy is conserved (in time-independent potentials with chaotic orbits). The fact that chaotic orbits no longer have the three actions as isolating integrals of motion means that they are free to explore a much larger volume in phase-space. Recall that regular orbits exist in 6D phase-space, but the existence of three actions limits orbits (with particular values for their actions) to exploring a 3D manifold embedded within the 6D phase-space. Orbits that only conserve energy as an integral of motion can instead explore a 5D manifold known as the *energy hypersurface*. \n",

    "### Chaotic Timescales\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all chaotic orbits obviously appear chaotic from their morphologies. This is often because some orbits are only *weakly chaotic* whereas others are *strongly chaotic*. There is no global definition to strong and weak chaos because it depends on the relevant timescales of whatever system you are looking at: Weakly chaotic orbits have a chaotic timescale much smaller than the dynamical time, whereas strongly chaotic orbits have comparable timescales. In the case of weakly chaotic orbits, the orbits may look and behave like nearby regular orbits for a long time (i.e. for all astronomically-relevant timescales). In the case of strongly chaotic orbits, the morphology of the orbit changes on the order of an orbital timescale, like in the example above.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of quantifying the strength of chaos for an orbit is with the *Maximum Lyapunov Exponent* or the inverse, sometimes called the *Lyapunov Time*. The MLE is a measure of how quickly two infinitesimally-close orbits diverge from one another. We will not go through the math to derive the MLE here (see section 3.7.3 c in Binney and Tremaine). However, I will note that you can compute the MLE in Gala using the `gala.dynamics.fast_lyapunov_max()` function. For example, for the two orbits shown above:"
