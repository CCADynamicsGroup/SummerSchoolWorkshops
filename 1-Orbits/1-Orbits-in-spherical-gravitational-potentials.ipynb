    "# Orbits 1: Orbits in Spherical Gravitational Potentials\n",
    "\n",
    "Author(s): Adrian Price-Whelan, Sarah Pearson\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning goals\n",
    "\n",
    "The main goal for this tutorial is to introduce the concept of orbits and numerically-computed trajectories using spherical gravitational potential models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "For many contexts in Galactic dynamics, the orbital trajectory of an object (star, planet, star cluster, satellite galaxy, etc.) is a fundamental tool for studying and interpreting the dynamical state, evolution, or initial conditions of a gravitational system. However, in general, we cannot directly observe any appreciable changes in position or velocity of a gravitating body over human timescales. As Galactic dynamicists, we therefore effectively only have access to measurements of a single kinematic snapshot of any dynamical system. With a kinematic snapshot and a model for the overall mass distribution of a system, we then seek to compute the past or future trajectories of the constituent bodies and use this information to, for example, refine our mass model, interpret kinematic features, or predict the evolution (past or present) of a system. In many such regimes, the mass of the orbiting body is small relative to the larger mass distribution in which it orbits (e.g., a star within a Galaxy). It is therefore often sufficient to treat an orbiting body as an effectively massless \"tracer\" particle whose trajectory is set by the broader mass distribution, and which does not cause any appreciable backreaction of the host system. (In later workshops, we will explore cases in which this assumption breaks down, such as with the Milky Way–LMC interaction.) In this context, a common goal is to compute the time-dependent position and velocity — the orbit — of an effectively massless body orbiting within an external gravitational field.\n",
    "\n",
    "While galaxies are actually composed of a large number of discrete point masses and structures (and we do not know the smallest size of dark matter substructures), it is often sufficient to model the mass distribution of a galaxy by considering smooth mass distributions (where the smoothing length scale is much smaller than the size of a galaxy, <<100 kpc, but larger than the spacing between massive structures, >>1 pc). As we saw in the lectures, and as you might recall from past Mechanics courses, the fundamental quantity in the context of computing orbits is the acceleration field $\\boldsymbol{a}(\\boldsymbol{x})$ specified often as a function of a three-dimensional position $\\boldsymbol{x}$. In convervative systems — or effectively conservative systems: neglecting star formation and death/supernovae for stars, and assuming that dark matter acts effectively like a collisionless fluid, the massive objects that make up a galaxy ineract only through gravitational interactions — the (vector) acceleration field can be directly computed as the gradient of the (scalar) gravitational potential $\\Phi(\\boldsymbol{x})$ of a system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{a}(\\boldsymbol{x}) = -\\nabla \\Phi(\\boldsymbol{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where the gravitational potential (sometimes later abbreviated simply as \"potential\") is related to the mass (density) distribution through Poisson's equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\nabla^2 \\Phi(\\boldsymbol{x}) = 4\\pi \\, G \\, \\rho(\\boldsymbol{x})\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "While the acceleration or gravitational field is \"closer\" to the dynamics (in that it is the force on a body that determines how it responds) and the density field is a direct representation of the mass distribution, it is often easier to work with and visualize the gravitational potential. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce some commonly-used spherical gravitational potential models, compute the orbits of particles in some of these models, and analyze the properties of orbits in spherical models.\n",

    "Aha! The energy of the computed orbit drifts steadily toward a nearly 100% change from the initial energy: This explains why the computed orbit does not look like a circular orbit, as we would expect. The fact that energy is not conserved is a consequence of the default integration method used by `solve_ivp()`: An (effectively) 4th-order Runge–Kutta method. Runge–Kutta methods are class of iterative schemes for computing approximate solutions for ordinary differential equations. However, they are approximate, and so these methods steadily accumulate errors. With `solve_ivp()`, we can control the error tolerance (the internal timestep used to perform the integration) using the function arguments `rtol` and `atol`, which set the threshold relative (rtol) and absolute (atol) error tolerances (see the [solve_ivp() documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.integrate.solve_ivp.html) for more context).\n",

    "## Other Integration Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "Runge–Kutta methods represent one class of numerical ODE integration tools, but there are several other classes of algorithms that are commonly used. Another class of algorithms that is used especially for evolving dynamical systems are *symplectic* integration methods. As we saw above with the Runge–Kutta scheme, over long times, errors introduced from approximations inherent to the method accumulate and lead to an increasing net change in the energy (which should be conserved). Symplectic integrators are special in that the iterative steps in the algorithm are *canonical transformations* themselves. A result of this is that, in conservative systems, over long times or averaged over time, these integrator classes conserve energy (in an average sense) and phase-space volume. In detail, the energy actually oscillates around the true energy, but it does not diverge from approximations in the method and only drifts due to numerical precision, which happens over much longer (integration) timescales.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most well-known symplectic integration methods is the [*Leapfrog algorithm*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leapfrog_integration), which is a specific type of more general Verlet integration schemes. Leapfrog is a 2nd-order method (the truncation error is 2nd-order) meaning that at fixed timestep, it will not be as precise as, for example, a 5th-order Runge–Kutta scheme. However, the approximate stability of the energy and the conserved phase volume is often desirable for long integrations. There are also 3rd, 4th, and higher-order analogs to Leapfrog integration that have better error properties (at fixed timestep) over short timescales.\n",

    "In the case of spherical, time-independent, central force fields, we saw above that energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$ (all components and the total magnitude) are integrals of motion. It turns out that the number of independent integrals of motion that an orbit has sets the degrees of freedom of an orbit in 6D phase space. That is, the reason that orbits do not fill six-dimensional volumes is because they often have many integrals of motion that reduce the dimensionality of the orbit (i.e. there are deep connections between coordinate symmetries, integrals of motion, and the geometry of orbits). However, we can create arbitrarily-many integrals of motion by considering any functions of these integrals of motion $f(E, L)$, so what is special about energy and angular momentum? Integrals of motion that reduce the number of degrees of freedom that an orbit has are called *isolating integrals of motion*: These are special integrals of motion that are \"independent\" (in detail, any such integrals are \"in involution\" such that the Poisson bracket of any pair of isolating integrals of motion must be zero; That is TMI for our purposes!). The number of isolating integrals of motion have geometric importance: Orbits exist in 6D phase space. If energy is conserved, this restricts orbits to a 5D manifold embedded in 6D phase space. In the case of spherical gravitational fields, the three components are three additional isolating integrals, which restrict the degrees of freedom to a 2D manifold: This is why generic orbits in spherical models (e.g., the Plummer model) trace out rosette patterns bound to a planar surface!

    "## Orbital Frequencies\n",
    "\n",
    "What controls whether an orbit closes on itself and fills a 1D curve instead of filling a 2D, 3D, etc. volume? One way to understand this aspect of orbital geometry is to consider its *orbital frequencies*. For a generic planar orbit, as we are considering here in spherical potentials, orbits have two fundamental orbital frequencies: One is related to the frequency with which the orbit circulates around (the azimuthal frequency $\\Omega_\\phi$), and the other is related to the frequency with which the orbit oscillates in and out in radius (the radial frequency $\\Omega_r$). In general spherical potentials, these frequencies will typically be irrational numbers, and they are set by the local slope of the density profile near an orbit. However, in certain mass models, or certain locations in general spherical models, these two frequencies can be *resonant*: Here, two frequencies are resonant if we can find two integers $n$ and $m$ such that $n\\,\\Omega_\\phi + m\\,\\Omega_r = 0$. In other words, the ratio of the orbital frequencies is a ratio of integers: $-\\frac{\\Omega_\\phi}{\\Omega_r} = \\frac{m}{n}$. Orbits that satisfy a resonance relation (a particular setting of $n$ and $m$) will close on themselves: For example, if $n=2$ and $m=1$, every revolution around in $\\phi$, there will be exactly 2 oscillations in $r$, bringing the orbital trajectory back to exactly the same place in phase space. Note that if the ratio was irrational, the orbit would not close because it would take an arbitrarily long time to come back to exactly the same place.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's estimate the orbital frequencies of the three orbits above and compute the frequency ratios to see if this gives us a better understanding of why the orbits have different morphologies. A quick and hacky way of estimating the frequencies is to find all of the local maxima in the radius $r$ and azimuth $\\phi$, difference the times, and take the mean. Thankfully, `scipy` provides utilities for identifying local maxima and minima, so the procedure to estimate the orbital frequencies (periods) will be: \n",

    "All of the spherical mass models above have utility in different contexts: Some have density profiles that are similar to observed light distributions in galaxies, some have circular velocity curves that match observed rotation curves in galaxies, and some are just fast to compute! There are many other possible choices for mass models that have, for example, truncated density distributions, or more complex radial dependencies, but often at the expense of simplicity: For example, some will require numerically solving for the potential or gradient, which introduces some overhead over the (mostly) analytic models discussed above. You may therefore encounter cases where people use sums or combinations of the models given above as a way of approximating more complex mass distributions, because potentials are additive.\n",
