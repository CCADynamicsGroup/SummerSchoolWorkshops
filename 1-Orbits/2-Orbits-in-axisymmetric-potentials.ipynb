    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in the previous tutorial, while spherical potential models can have complex radial density profiles, orbits in spherical potential models are planar and can be characterized by their radial and azimuthal frequencies because these orbits have at least four isolating integrals of motion (energy and the three components of angular momentum). As we will see in this tutorial, as the symmetries of a potential model are relaxed (from spherical to axisymmetric, and then in the next tutorial, from axisymmetric to triaxial), the number of isolating integrals of motion for a generic orbit decreases to three, and they become difficult to compute. The implication of this is that generic orbits in non-spherical potential models are no longer confined to a plane: They fill a three-dimensional volume instead of a two-dimensional region. In addition, these more complex models have regions of *chaotic* or irregular orbits, which differ from regular orbits in many important ways, as we will see in the next tutorial. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will introduce some commonly-used axisymmetric gravitational potential models, compute the orbits of particles in some of these models, and analyze the properties of orbits in non-spherical models.\n",

    "## Axisymmetric Potential Models\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than having spherical symmetry, axisymmetric potential models are symmetric to rotations around a particular axis. A common use case for these potential models is for representing flattened and disky systems (like the stellar and gas disks of the Milky Way). A common way of constructing axisymmetric potentials is to start with a spherical potential model, but replace the spherical radius with an elliptical radius that breaks the symmetry between $x, y$ and $z$. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "r = \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2} \\rightarrow \\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + (|z| + a)^2}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "By convention, in many contexts we will take the $z$ axis to be the symmetry axis, so we often use cylindrical coordinates $R, z$ when working with axisymmetric models. \n",
    "\n",
    "One commonly-used axisymmetric model is the Miyamoto–Nagai (MN) potential, which is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\Phi_{\\textrm{MN}}(R, z) = - \\frac{G\\, M}{\\sqrt{R^2 + (a + \\sqrt{z^2 + b^2})^2}}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In the limit that $a \\rightarrow 0$, the MN potential reduces to the spherical Plummer model introduced in the previous tutorial. In the limit that $b \\rightarrow 0$, the MN potential reduces to the potential generated by an infinitely-thin disk. Depending on the setting of $a$ and $b$, we can represent a variety of flattened density distributions, like galactic stellar or gas disks. \n",
    "\n",
    "To get a feel for how orbits behave in axisymmetric potentials, we will compute some orbits in the MN potential using [Gala](http://gala.adrian.pw/). We will start by defining a model that has parameters similar to the stellar mass distribution in the local part of the Galactic disk (parameter values taken from [this paper](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJ...910...17P/abstract)):"

To demonstrate the types of orbits that we see in axisymmetric potentials, we will therefore compute three orbits in both the MN and comparison Plummer potentials using the circular velocity to inform our initial conditions. In the example below, we will start one orbit in the $x,y$ plane, one started slightly above the $x,y$ plane, and a third started far above the $x,y$ plane."

    "## Integrals of motion for axisymmetric orbits: Connection to action-angle coordinates\n",
    "\n",
    "We have talked a lot about approximating orbits in axisymmetric potentials because most stars in the Milky Way are on orbits that can be described using the terminology and quantities we have discussed so far. We have focused a lot on the different frequencies that an orbit can have in different cylindrical coordinates, assuming that the motion is separable. However another important aspect of the geometry of axisymmetric orbits is the *amplitude* of oscillation in the different coordinates. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we discussed early on in this tutorial, in axisymmetric models, a generic orbit has three integrals of motion, which could be energy, $z$-component of angular momentum, and the \"third integral.\" It turns out that any orbit also has a different set of three integrals of motion that has a closer connection to the orbital geometry we discussed: something close to the amplitude of oscillations in the radial direction, something close to the amplitude of oscillations in the vertical direction, and the $z$-component of angular momentum (which is the analog of the others for the azimuthal direction) — these are the \"radial action\" $J_R$, the \"vertical action\" $J_z$, and the \"azimuthal action\" $J_\\phi = L_z$. I added the phrase \"something close to\" in the previous sentence because the actions are not exactly related to the amplitudes in $R$ and $z$: Most of the expressions and intuition-building approximations we have made above have been under the assumption that the potential is separable in these coordinates. But we also saw that this is not true in detail (there is curvature to the orbital boundaries when orbits are plotted in the meridional $R,Z$ plane). The actions are like a generalization of the conceptual / approximate arguments we made above, but which take into account the fact that the orbits are not separable in detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actions are special and useful for a number of reasons. For one, they connect to the intuitions we built about orbits above: For example, orbits with larger radial action have larger oscillations in $R$, and the same for $z$. But, as mentioned briefly in the previous tutorial, they also help define a dynamically-useful coordinate system known as action-angle coordinates. In this coordinate system, any point in ordinary phase-space $(\\boldsymbol{x}, \\boldsymbol{v})$ can be represented instead by a location in action-angle coordinates $(\\boldsymbol{\\theta}, \\boldsymbol{J})$, where for axisymmetric orbits the actions and angles are:\n",

    "\n",
    "where $J_\\phi = L_z$, and in the limit $J_R, J_z \\rightarrow 0$, $\\theta_\\phi \\rightarrow \\phi$.\n",
    "\n",
    "The actions, which are the momentum coordinates, are integrals of motion, so $\\dot{\\boldsymbol{J}} = 0$. The Hamiltonian equations of motion are therefore:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\dot{J}_i = -\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial \\theta_i} = 0\\\\\n",
    "\\dot{\\theta}_i = \\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial J_i}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This implies that the Hamiltonian $H$ must depend only on the actions, and so the expressions $\\frac{\\partial H}{\\partial J_i}$ must be a function only of the actions. We can therefore integrate the equations of motion for the angle variables:\n",

    "Action-angle coordinates are conceptually and dynamically very useful, and there is a lot more to be said about them. However, a subtlety of working with these coordinates is that it is often challenging to transform from $(x, v) \\rightarrow (J, \\theta)$ and even more challenging to transform back $(J, \\theta) \\rightarrow (x, v)$. The transformation often requires either numerically integrating an orbit for a long time, or making approximations to the potential (that often are not valid for all types of orbits). We will not talk much about the different methods for numerically estimating actions and angles (unless you ask!), but we recommend checking out [Sanders et al. 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016MNRAS.457.2107S/abstract) if you are interested."
