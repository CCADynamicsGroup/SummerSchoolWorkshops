# Workshop 2: Galaxies and collections of orbits

---
This repository contains three notebooks:
* [1-phase-mixing.ipynb](./1-phase-mixing.ipynb)
* [2-generating-self-consistent-galaxies.ipynb](./2-generating-self-consistent-galaxies.ipynb)
* [3-streams.ipynb](./3-streams.ipynb)

The material in these notebooks - including all optional exercises - is probably
more than we can cover during the workshop. I suggest spending about 30 minutes
on notebook 1 and 1 hour each on notebooks 2 and 3. It is absolutely fine to
skip most of the optional material. The best approach is to quickly move through
the notebooks and to go back to the parts that you find the most interesting to
explore those in more detail.

### Description of the notebooks
Notebook 1:\
In this notebook we will explore the phase-space spiral, also known as the
'Galactic snail shell'. The snail shell is thought to be the result of a
perturbation of the disk of the Milky Way. In the notebook we will see why this
is the case.

Notebook 2:\
Generating mock galaxies from scratch can be challenging. In this notebook we
will construct simple spherical galaxies and explore some of the difficulties in
doing this.

Notebook 3:\
In this notebook we will track the evolution of stellar systems orbiting the
Milky Way. Satellite galaxies, such as globular clusters and dwarf galaxies,
will evolve into so-called streams of stars once they become unbound. In this
notebook we will study streams and their evolution.
